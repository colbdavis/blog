## The problem

Open Code seems like an useful tool for someone like me who wants to code with the help of llms without spending lots of time switching between a browser and a shell.

The problem is that, from my undertanding, Open Code does not provide secure defaults, or security measures to help the user stay secure [Article about it](https://cy.md/opencode-rce/) (the server isn't running on default anymore but it isn't clear in the interface when it is)

It also is certainly indirectly vulnerable to Prompt Injection, from the models of the providers.

I suggest reading the AI Owasp Top 10 list [here](https://genai.owasp.org/2025/12/09/owasp-genai-security-project-releases-top-10-risks-and-mitigations-for-agentic-ai-security/)

## The apparent solution

Since on the docs opencode supports running inside of a container, I would've launched it with security mesures such as mounted volumes and no-root.

However today i really tried to vibe-solve (if it is even a term ahah) this issue, without succes.
